# Autonomous_Cars

Abstract: Drowsiness of driver is one of the most significant cause of road accident. In this work, we present an embedded system that that simulates a real-time drowsiness detection system based on visual information. We propose three different components that communicate via Bluetooth. Specifically, we use a two-wheel car developed on Tiva LaunchPad to simulate a real autopilot car. A Raspberry Pi is used as a detection system to communicate the eye closure with the car and activate the autonomous mode of the car. Moreover, we provide a LCD display of the current car status to mimic a cloud system that monitors the current car status.
